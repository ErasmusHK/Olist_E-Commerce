The dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. 

Furthermore, we collect more data such as "Per capita income", "Gross domestic product" and "Population distribution" from the Brazilian government website. 

After synthesizing all the information, we analyze and make relevant marketing suggestions using 6 headings: "KPI", "Black Friday", "Delivery", "Product", "Customer" and "Review".
